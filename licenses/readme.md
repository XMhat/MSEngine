# License files…

These are the licenses for the third-party libraries used in MS-Engine.

The syntax format is `Lic-<Date>-<LibName>-<Type>.txt`, where…

* `<Date>` is the date the license was updated in `YYYYMMDD`.
* `<LibName>` is the name of the library.
* `<Type>` is the type of license acronym.

We respect and honour the hard work of the authors of all the third-party code thus all of creditation for this work is compressed and compiled into the MS-Engine executable at compilation as static C++ code. They are decompressed and read with the `credits` console commands or via Lua within the `Credits` namespace.
